						<div class="align-left">
							<p>  The University of Washington (through the Urbanalytics Studio, a partnership between the <a href="http://escience.washington.edu/">UW eScience Institute</a> and <a href="http:urban.uw.edu">Urban@UW</a>) and the University of British Columbia (through a partnership between <a href="http://dsi.ubc.ca/">UBC’s Data Science Institute</a> and <a href="https://sustain.ubc.ca/">UBC’s Sustainability Initiative</a>) have formed the Cascadia Urban Analytics Cooperative (CUAC), an applied, interdisciplinary, regional center that will bring together academic researchers, students, and public stakeholder groups to address topics affecting citizens of the Cascadia region. The specific focus of the Cascadia Urban Analytics Cooperative will be data science for social good in an urban context: high-impact data science and analytics projects that aim to understand and extract valuable actionable information out of data from urban environments in the Cascadia region. Funded in part by <a href="https://www.https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/about">Microsoft</a>, this partnership is pursuing three primary initiatives at the outset:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Urban data science for social good summer programs at UW and UBC</li>
								<li>A cross university undergraduate research symposium</li>
								<li>Long term smart cities research</li>
							</ul>

							<p> Urbanalytics together with <a href="http://urban.uw.edu">Urban@UW</a> is proud to be a participating in the <a href="http://metrolab.heinz.cmu.edu/" title="">MetroLab Network</a>, an initiative of the White House aimed at activating smart city principles through targeted partnerships between cities and universities. The City of Seattle, led by CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikematt" title="">Michael Mattmiller</a>, and the University of Washington, led by Bill Howe, are hosting one of 40 city-university partnerships in this national network, each striving to develop technological and data-grounded solutions to challenges facing urban areas. Our partnership is focused on leveraging smart city technology for social good. Funded in part by the <a href="https://www.macfound.org/">MacArthur Foundation</a>, this partnership is addressing three projects at the outset:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Working with <a href="https://arrayofthings.github.io/" title="Array of Things">University of Chicago</a> to deploy sensors to monitor and evaluate micro-environmental dynamics on the streets of Seattle;</li>
								<li>Supporting UW’s <a href="http://techpolicylab.org/" title="Tech Policy Lab">Tech Policy Lab</a> in developing policy to address the ethics and implications for data sharing at the city scale; and</li>
								<li>Facilitating the <a href="https://www.ee.washington.edu/" title="UW Department of Electrical Engineering">Department of Electrical Engineering</a> in examining the relationships between temperature and power grid activity in anticipation of extreme heat events associated with climate change.</li>
							</ul>

							<p> Through these and future projects, our ambition is to leverage city-university and city-to-city partnerships to broaden knowledge-sharing and collectively work towards addressing urban challenges that affect multiple communities: from individual citizens and institutions, to the city itself. </p>
