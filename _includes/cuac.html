							<p>  Over 80% of the planet is affected by increased urbanization – a clarion call for evidence-based innovation to improve the resiliency, health, and well-being of cities and their inhabitants. To lead a focused response, the University of Washington (through a partnership between the <a href="http://escience.washington.edu/">UW eScience Institute</a> and <a href="http:urban.uw.edu">Urban@UW</a>) and the University of British Columbia (through a partnership between <a href="http://dsi.ubc.ca/">UBC’s Data Science Institute</a> and <a href="https://sustain.ubc.ca/">UBC’s Sustainability Initiative</a>) have formed the Cascadia Urban Analytics Cooperative (CUAC), an applied, interdisciplinary, regional center that will bring together academic researchers, students, and public stakeholder groups to address topics affecting citizens of the Cascadia region. The specific focus of the Cascadia Urban Analytics Cooperative will be data science for social good in an urban context: high-impact data science and analytics projects that aim to understand and extract valuable actionable information out of data from urban environments in the Cascadia region. Funded in part by <a href="https://www.https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/about">Microsoft</a>, this partnership is pursuing three primary initiatives at the outset:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Urban data science for social good summer programs at UW and UBC</li>
								<li>A cross university undergraduate research symposium</li>
								<li>Long term smart cities research</li>
							</ul>
