		<p> Urbanalytics together with <a href="http://urban.uw.edu">Urban@UW</a> is proud to be a participating in the <a href="http://metrolab.heinz.cmu.edu/" title="">MetroLab Network</a>, an initiative of the White House aimed at activating smart city principles through targeted partnerships between cities and universities. The City of Seattle, led by CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikematt">Michael Mattmiller</a>, and the University of Washington, led by Bill Howe, are hosting one of 40 city-university partnerships in this national network, each striving to develop technological and data-grounded solutions to challenges facing urban areas. Our partnership is focused on leveraging smart city technology for social good. Funded in part by the <a href="https://www.macfound.org/">MacArthur Foundation</a>, this partnership is addressing three projects at the outset:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Working with <a href="https://arrayofthings.github.io/">University of Chicago</a> to deploy sensors to monitor and evaluate micro-environmental dynamics on the streets of Seattle;</li>
			<li>Supporting UWâ€™s <a href="http://techpolicylab.org/">Tech Policy Lab</a> in developing policy to address the ethics and implications for data sharing at the city scale; and</li>
			<li>Facilitating the <a href="https://www.ee.washington.edu/">Department of Electrical Engineering</a> in examining the relationships between temperature and power grid activity in anticipation of extreme heat events associated with climate change.</li>
		</ul>
		<p> Through these and future projects, our ambition is to leverage city-university and city-to-city partnerships to broaden knowledge-sharing and collectively work towards addressing urban challenges that affect multiple communities: from individual citizens and institutions, to the city itself. </p>
