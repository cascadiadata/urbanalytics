The University of Washington [eScience Institute](http://escience.washington.edu/), in collaboration with the [Cascadia Urban Analytics Cooperative](http://cascadiadata.org/), is excited to announce the fourth offering of the [Data Science for Social Good](http://escience.washington.edu/dssg/) summer program taking place from June 11 - August 17, 2018.

Short proposals are welcome for 10-week data-intensive research projects requiring collaboration in scalable data management, statistical analysis and machine learning, open source software development, cloud and cluster computing, and/or visualization. Accepted projects will be undertaken by a team of four interdisciplinary students, and co-led by an external Project Lead and one or more Data Scientists in the eScience Institute.

Graduate students and advanced (junior/senior) undergraduate students (including spring graduates) are invited to apply. 

[Fellowship applications](http://escience.washington.edu/get-involved/incubator-programs/data-science-for-social-good/) are due February 12, 2018.

[Project proposals](http://escience.washington.edu/dssg-proposal) are due February 25, 2018.
