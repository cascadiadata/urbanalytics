In the Seattle region seven transportation agencies use a common electronic fare payment system, called ORCA â€“ One Regional Card for All. In 2009 when ORCA was adopted, the advantage of moving from a simple paper card to electronic media was that data produced would provide travel behavior information, which could be used to improve transportation planning and decision-making. To date this opportunity has not been routinely realized.

The Urbanalytics Studio together with Hallenbeck and the Washington State Transportation Center are doing work in the following areas. 

* **Responsible data use and privacy:** In the context of information, which can reflect a rider's movement through the city, employment, and income affiliations. 
* **Efficient data handling:** As the seven transit agencies amass multi-gigabite d ata files there is a need for better ways to process, merge, store, and handle this information. 
* **Facilitation transportation analysis:**  Once the data has been processed, better ways to visualize, summarize and query these data will allow transportation specialists to better understand patterns and inefficiencies which can be used to develop more effecting service and operations plans.
* **Equity analysis:** Better understanding low-income  use patterns, the impact of employer transit subsidies, and a wide range of built environment variables can facilitation more equitable planning.
