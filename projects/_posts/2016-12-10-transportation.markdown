Supported by the Urbanalytics Studio this project emerged out of the [Data Science for Social Good 2016](http://escience.washington.edu/dssg/project-summaries-2016/) program and is led by Mark Hallenbeck and the [Washington State Transportation Center](http://depts.washington.edu/trac/).  

Seven regional transportation agencies use a common electronic fare payment system, called ORCA â€“ One Regional Card for All. When ORCA was initially conceived and adopted (it has been in use since June 2009), the regional expectation was that one advantage of moving from simple visual card (A visual, paper monthly pass) to electronic media was that the resulting data would provide travel behavior information that could be used to improve regional transportation system planning and decision making. To date, that secondary purpose for ORCA data has not been routinely realized.

Transit and planning agencies of the region are eager to put this data to use in social and transportation analyses, however there are significant technical and ethical considerations that are still being addressed.   

**Responsible data use and privacy**,  is a particularly salient concern in the context of information that has the potential to not only reflects a rider's movement through the city, but also maybe be linked employment and income affiliations through subsidies. 

**Efficient data handling**, is another important area of inquiry for this project.  As transit agencies amass data, there is a need for better ways to process, store, and handle the multi-gigabite files, produced by multiple agencies, which can result from mere days of collection.  

By **facilitating transportation analysis** ultimately these data sets can be used as decision support tools. Providing better ways to store, visualize, summarize and query these data, will allow transportation specialists to understand ridership patterns and system inefficiencies which can be used to develop more effective service and operations plans.  

**Equity analysis** is another critical area for this research. This involves, understanding when, where, and how often low income users take transit, and how those travel patterns differ from other users.  As well, expanding initial work that has been done examining the impact of employer transit subsidies, as well as a wide range of built environment variables. Geographic connections come into play here as well. Which portions of the region are interacting the most, and how efficient are the movements between those geographic zones? Does the transit system effectively serve all geographic areas? Are lower income groups being effectively served by transit?
